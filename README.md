## Lab 01

In Lab 01, I worked on various tasks involving dictionary manipulation, looping with lists and dictionaries, and NumPy array manipulation. I created and updated dictionaries to represent student information and inventory items, used for loops and while loops to iterate through lists and dictionaries, and performed operations such as adding new subjects, updating ages, and printing personalized messages. Additionally, I manipulated NumPy arrays by calculating statistical measures, reshaping arrays, performing matrix multiplication, and filtering values based on a threshold.
