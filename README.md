## Lab 01

In Lab 01, I worked on various tasks involving dictionary manipulation, looping with lists and dictionaries, and NumPy array manipulation. I created and updated dictionaries to represent student information and inventory items, used for loops and while loops to iterate through lists and dictionaries, and performed operations such as adding new subjects, updating ages, and printing personalized messages. Additionally, I manipulated NumPy arrays by calculating statistical measures, reshaping arrays, performing matrix multiplication, and filtering values based on a threshold.

## Lab 02

In Lab 02, I implemented a Reflex Agent Program for the Vacuum Cleaner World Problem. The agent's goal is to clean all rooms (A, B, and C) by performing actions such as cleaning the current room or moving to the next room. The program includes functions to check the goal state, clean rooms, move between rooms, and handle the agent's behavior based on the room's status. The agent's task is to clean the rooms and report the sequence of actions performed to reach the goal state, along with the total path cost.
