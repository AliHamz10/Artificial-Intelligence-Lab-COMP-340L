## Lab 01

In Lab 01, I worked on various tasks involving dictionary manipulation, looping with lists and dictionaries, and NumPy array manipulation. I created and updated dictionaries to represent student information and inventory items, used for loops and while loops to iterate through lists and dictionaries, and performed operations such as adding new subjects, updating ages, and printing personalized messages. Additionally, I manipulated NumPy arrays by calculating statistical measures, reshaping arrays, performing matrix multiplication, and filtering values based on a threshold.

## Lab 02

In Lab 02, I implemented a Reflex Agent Program for the Vacuum Cleaner World Problem. The agent's goal is to clean all rooms (A, B, and C) by performing actions such as cleaning the current room or moving to the next room. The program includes functions to check the goal state, clean rooms, move between rooms, and handle the agent's behavior based on the room's status. The agent's task is to clean the rooms and report the sequence of actions performed to reach the goal state, along with the total path cost.

## Lab 03

In Lab 03, I implemented a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm.

## Lab 04

In Lab 04 of the Artificial Intelligence course, I implemented the A* Search Algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid with obstacles, using the Manhattan distance heuristic. The lab consisted of two tasks: the first involved implementing A* to determine its completeness and optimality, while the second required applying A* to both unweighted and weighted graphs, comparing its efficiency with BFS and analyzing its suitability for weighted graphs. The implementation included writing Python code for both graph types and providing observations on when to use A* effectively.

## Lab 05

In this lab, we implemented the Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe, optimizing decision-making using adversarial search. The task involved coding minimax, testing game outcomes, and documenting the approach in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Lab 06

In Lab 06, I implemented the Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe, enhancing the Minimax Algorithm's efficiency by reducing the search space. The lab required coding the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, testing game outcomes, and comparing the results with the Minimax Algorithm.
